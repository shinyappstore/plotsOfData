# plotsOfData: Comparing Experimental Conditions Made Easy

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/plotsOfData](https://shinyappstore.com/a/plotsOfData)__

plotsOfData is a versatile application that visualizes unpaired data from different conditions, offering various statistical summaries and customizable output tables. The tool's philosophy emphasizes transparency and interpretation by plotting raw data, enhancing the comparison of experimental conditions. It allows users to control the visibility of both raw data and statistics by adjusting transparency levels. The application includes summary statistics like mean, median, and box plots, along with inferential statistics such as confidence intervals. Bootstrapping is used to calculate asymmetric 95% confidence intervals for medians. Data can be supplied in either spreadsheet/long format or tidy format. Additionally, the generated plots can be saved as PDF files for further editing using software like Adobe Illustrator to fine-tune the layout.
